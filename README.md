# REfracting Website Homework

In this homework I will be editing a websites code to be more modern and easier to use for the handicapped. I will be changing the tags to be easer to understand, which allows one with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions to access and understand the website.

# How I do it

I will be changing any HTML tags to its modern tag. For example, if there is a <div> tag that is for the header, I will be changing it to the modern HTML tag of <header>.
